# ml-AI-Programming-Python

For the final project of Udacity's AI programming with Python Nanodegree I was tasked with constructing an image classifier (using PyTorch) that could differentiate between 102 different flower types.

## Concepts used
- Transfer Learning
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Preprocessing
- Data Augmentation
- Dropout Regularization
- Cross Entropy Loss / Softmax Probabilities
- Concurrent Training and Validation
- Saving and Loading Pytorch Models
- Using a given model for inference

## Files

Jupyter Notebook - shows the code as well as the results of running it

.py scripts - taken together provide utility as a command line tool for training a model and using it for inference
